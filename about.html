				<p>We created the Acme Web Design Site Builder with the user's perspective in mind. We wanted to offer a platform that would require few coding skills or design experience. We keep it simple, so users can focus on creating an amazing website that reflects their brand. We believe every individual should have the power to create their own website or online store. If you can point and click, you can create a professional website or online store using our free and intuitive tools. </p>

				<p class="dark">After seeing an increased need for ecommerce solutions, we developed one of the only fully-featured, free and commission-free online store builders, allowing business owners to launch their online business. Today, we're proud to empower individuals and small business owners around the world. Everyone deserves a website, and we're excited to see what you create and we give the Best of all. You can get online, showcase your brand, or start selling products right away. Traditional web hosting services were simply too complicated, time consuming, and expensive to manage.</p>
